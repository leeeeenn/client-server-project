                  I'm a third year computer engineering student, I speak Arabic,
                  English, French and Spanish. throughout my academic years at
                  BZU, concerning the software part, I completed a pizza
                  restaurant program and a student database successfully.
                  regarding the hardware and electrical section, I completed a
                  simple computer program and two cricuit and electronics
                  simulation programs. I love spending my freetime reading, and
                  watching my favorite series "friends " :)).

                    An ambitious little woman, a team player, and a good friendâ€”this is how I love to describe myself. 
                    I've known that I wanted to study everything there is to know about programming and computers 
                    since I learned my first programming language in 2018. 
                    I've worked on some personal projects, including a simple game similar to Agar.io,
                     an application to connect bullying victims to therapists, a website to teach kids simple first aid ,
                      and recently, I presented a prototype for a website for Sanad organization to help kids with autism. 
                      Also, during my three years of study as a computer engineer, I had to work on many projects.

                    What do I love to do in my free time? Well, I'm a third-year commputer engineering student; we don't have free time.

                  <p>
                   content type is the way HTTP defines 
                   the actual type of information or media 
                   used in its body.
                   i.e, if the content type is set to "text/HTML"
                   Then it will be an HTML file.
                   another example if the date type is set to " image/png"
                   then it will be an image of a png extension.
                   if this format is not used, then
                   the receiver will be indentify the media type
                   based on the content or the file extension provided. if it's still ambigious 
                   then it will be defined as a generic binary file "application/octet-stream".
